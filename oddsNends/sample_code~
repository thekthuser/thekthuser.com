Sample Code



Blocks Puzzle

A fun puzzle someone sent me. I wrote the solution in Python. Given a sequence of blocks of random lengths, arrange them into columns without changing their order such that the sum of the differences between each column length and the average length of all columns is minimized.

TI-BASIC

The following programs are some of the first I ever wrote. I got a TI-83+ graphing calculator for math classes in high school and when I realized I could make games on it I set about doing that. They were lost for many years until I discovered them backed up onto a cd in the attic. The source code was still lost for a few years following that because they were set to be non-editable. I was finally able to recover the source with the help of some TI assembly utilities. If you want to run them you will need a TI-83+ emulator and ROM in addition to the linked 8XP files. A blog explaining that process is linked here.

(explain zips are source and 8XP?)

FORMULAS

I cut my teeth automating formulas as they were introduced during math classes. This program is a collection of several of those. There are (X) listed and they are mostly Trigonometry and Pre-Calculus level mathematics.

MAROONED

MAROONED is the first game I wrote. The player is stuck on a deserted island and needs to survive until a plane can be signaled. The game can be finished in about 5 minutes, but is highly dependent on luck.

DIABLO

Blizzard's Diablo was a favorite game of mine and this is a text-only version (tribute?) of that for the TI-83+. All 3 character classes are available, can gain experience, and equip different weapons. There are many monsters from the original game included and most, if not all, bosses which are randomly encountered.
