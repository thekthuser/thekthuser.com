The Reddit Picture Frame

The idea here was to find a use for extra displays. The frame will look at the top 100 posts in r/all, pick those that link directly to an image, and display them in a random order. After getting to the end of that list (usually between 40 and 50 minutes), it will look at the new top 100 posts and start over. 

If you have a spare display, pull this up and leave it running. You will see something new every minute.

Rmas

Rmas is a non-profit I have been working with for a while. I have contributed to all aspects of the site; from systems administration to the back and frontend development.

The goal is to help immigrants send money home easily and efficiently. We are nearing launch and will begin by focusing on zip code 11220 in Brooklyn, NY.

Socially Awkward Magazine

Socially Awkward Magazine is a Wordpress site that the owner asked me for help on. I created a custom page for displaying artists who blog on the site. I also tidied up his original install by installing and removing appropriate plugins and adjusting his configuration to eliminate any security issues, etc. There is more work to be done, but the owner is not yet ready.

ABOUT

What is kth?
Pronounced "kayth";  a specific, yet arbitrary number.
1 .. k .. n

Why this theme?
The color scheme is based on my coding environment. The font is different, but Inconsolata is a better looking monospaced font for this purpose.

Who is kth?
I am a developer living in the NY/Tri-state area. Python is often my language of choice, but lately I have been using PHP and JavaScript more often. At home I run openSUSE with KDE. In the past I have used other Linux distros as well as Mac and Windows. I like "jailbreaking" my devices and eventually I do that to everything I own.
