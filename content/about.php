<h2>Who is k<sup>th</sup>?</h2>
<p>I am a web developer who likes working in Python, but also has experience in various other languages, dating all the way back to TI-BASIC on a Texas Instruments graphing calculator.</p>
<p>I am a long time Linux user who has tried several different distros (currently settled on Kubuntu), an avid reader of tech news, and a tinkerer who eventually 'jailbreaks' every device I own.</p>
<p>Outside of tech I am a hobbyist chef who is always on the lookout for new recipes.</p>
