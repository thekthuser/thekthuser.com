<h2>Why is k<sup>th</sup> monospaced?</h2>
<p>The color scheme is based on my coding environment. The font is different, but Inconsolata is a better looking font for this purpose. The Reddit Picture Frame, although hosted here, doesn't match the rest of the site because it's meant to stand on it's own.</p>

<h2>Who is k<sup>th</sup>?</h2>
<p>I am a developer living in the NY/Westcheser area. Python is often my language of choice, but lately I have been using PHP and Javascript more often. At home I run openSUSE with KDE. In the past I have used other Linux distros as well as Mac and Windows. I like "jailbreaking" my devices and eventually I do that to everything I own.</p>
