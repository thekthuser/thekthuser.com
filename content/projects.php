<h2>Approachable Art</h2>
<p>An art gallery and store split into two sites. The gallery is finished. The store is not. These are my first and second Django projects, respectively. Artwork can be displayed in three sizes: thumbnails for browsing, screen-size, and full-size to see fine detail. An admin dashboard allows artists to add/edit/remove works and biographical information.</p>

<h2>The Reddit Picture Frame</h2>
<p>The idea here was to find a use for extra displays. The frame will look at the top 100 posts in r/all, pick those that link directly to an image, and display them in a random order. After getting to the end of that list (usually between 40 and 50 minutes), it will look at the new top 100 posts and start over.</p>
<p>If you have a spare display, pull this up and leave it running. You will see something new every minute.
<p>To keep bandwidth usage to an absolute minimum The Reddit Picture Frame was written entirely in Javascript. I do not keep a copy of recent images on the server.</p>

<h2>Hiroko Creative Educator</h2>
<p>This is a very simple site that was recreated pixel for pixel mostly to get the owner off of a web host that was ripping her off.</p>

<h2>Second Saturday</h2>
<p>Second Saturday Staten Island is a monthly art walk on Staten Island, NY. The site was static originally. After recovering the domain and web hosting from its previous owner I wrote the backend in PHP with a MySQL database. The new admin console allows the site maintainers to post updates without mucking about in HTML. A dynamic Google Map was also added to show the locations of sponsors, members, and events.</p>
<p>Note: As of July 2015 this site is under new management and no longer using my code.</p>

<h2>Socially Awkward Magazine</h2>
<p>Socially Awkward Magazine is a Wordpress site that the owner asked me for help on. I created a custom page for displaying artists who blog on the site. I also tidied up his original install by adding and removing appropriate plugins and adjusting his configuration to eliminate any security issues, etc.</p>
<p>Note: This site is no longer live.</p>

<h2>TrickleUp</h2>
<p>TrickleUp was one of several non-profits who participated in the Helping Hacks hackathon in August 2012. A team of originally five people worked together to improve TrickleUp's internal data collection and visualization system. We received the "best technical solution" award. Progress is stalled waiting for more input from TrickleUp.</p>
